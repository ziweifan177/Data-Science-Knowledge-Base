### This project includes:
#### 1. Analysis & Predict trip duration of taxi Based on Climate & Geospatial data 
#### 2. Flare visualization;  

##### A. Taxi Trip analysis:  
* From the driver’s:  
What the hot areas for passenger to request taxi? And what the time slot? I will analysis based on geospatial data & time data.  
The drivers could go to these areas during some exact time slot. It more likely they could have more passengers.  
It is more likely that there is increasing number of passenger around downtown of Manhattan during 5:00-7:00, is it true?  

* From the driver’s side:  
I will predict the total ride duration based on historical records, such as longitude, latitude.  

##### B. Weather-Traffic Analysis:  
* Is there any relationship between weather and duration?  
* (In rainy days, pavement friction goes down with the higher wetness, and lower visibility distance goes with the rainfall.  
* Accordingly, it is more likely that these aspects will affect the performance of the drivers. The duration will go with these aspects.)
